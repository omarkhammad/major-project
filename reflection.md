# Major Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself?
- Choose a more creative project that you're passionate about
- Do more research on the harder mechanics behind tetris before starting, especially block rotation and possibly wall kicks 
- Make sure you meet your needs to haves before adding bells and whistles
- Spend time properly commenting and adding variables to the code while writing

## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- Almost, I forgot to increase the difficult by speeding up the rate at which the blocks fall

## The hardest part?
- Adding functional block rotation, all the coordinates were written by hand and trial and error was difficult
- Fixing a sustain bug that shows up out of "nowhere" which showed up randomly which made it hard to debug and wasted A LOT of my time

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
- I wasn't able to add a side bar for upcoming blocks and one for the swapped block
- Adding visual effects
- But luckily all bugs were solved
