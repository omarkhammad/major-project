# Project Description

I am going to make a Tetris game

## Needs to have list

- High Score Tracker
- Score system
- If a whole row is full of blocks, it clears the row
- Shapes can be rotated, moved left right, and down
- Random block generation
- Difficulty increases over time by speeding up falling of blocks
- Background music
- Sound affects

## Nice to have list 

- A sidebar that shows your future blocks
- Falling blocks can be swapped out
- Falling blocks show an outline on where they are projected to fall
- Holding a movement button down speeds up the movement
